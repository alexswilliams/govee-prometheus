Most successful commandline so far:
sudo podman run \
  --net=host \
  --cap-add NET_RAW \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  --rm localhost/alexswilliams/govee-prom:latest

sudo needed to run setsockopt on HCI sockets
NET_RAW allows opening HCI sockets and enumerating the available interfaces
apparmor was getting in the way of propagating the SIGINT to children, podman was disowning the children and leaving them orphaned

To run locally:
make && sudo BT_ALIASES=sample-devices.csv ./bin/monitor
